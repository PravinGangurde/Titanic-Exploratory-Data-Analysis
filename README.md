# Titanic-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Analysis the Titanic dataset using EDA with different libraries (Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn)
Titanic Dataset Analysis Project (Python)
1. Introduction
The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular datasets used for learning data analysis, statistics, and machine learning. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic and whether they survived or not. This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to uncover patterns and insights.
2. Dataset Description
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains passenger-level information.
Key columns in the dataset include:
• PassengerId – Unique identifier
• Survived – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
• Pclass – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
• Name – Passenger name
• Sex – Gender
• Age – Age of passenger
• SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
• Parch – Number of parents/children aboard
• Fare – Ticket fare
• Embarked – Port of embarkation
3. Objective of the Project
• Understand the structure of the Titanic dataset
• Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
• Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Identify important factors affecting survival
• Prepare data Visuals for Dashboard.
4. Tools and Libraries Used
• Python
• Pandas – Data manipulation
• Seaborn – Data visualization
• Matplotlib – Data visualization

5. Data Loading and Understanding
The dataset is loaded using Pandas read_csv() function. Initial exploration includes checking the first few rows, understanding data types, and generating summary statistics using info() and describe().
6. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning steps performed in this project include:
• Handling missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns
• Filling Age with mean 
• Filling Embarked with mode
• Dropping Cabin due to excessive missing values
• Checking and handling duplicates
7. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is used to understand the relationship between different features and survival.
Key analyses include:
• Survival count distribution
• Survival based on gender
• Survival based on passenger class
• Age distribution and survival
• Fare analysis
8. Visualizations
The following visualizations are used in the project:
• Count plots for survival distribution
• Bar plots for survival vs gender and class
• Box plots for Age group
9. Key Insights
• Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males
• Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive
• Children had better survival chances
• Higher fare passengers showed higher survival probability

11. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis in understanding data. The Titanic dataset clearly shows how gender, class, and age influenced survival. The dataset is ideal for beginners to practice data analysis and machine learning concepts.
